# A Random Image a Day

A program to generate a random image each day in hopes of eventually creating something great. Inspired by a million monkeys on typewriters eventually writing some Shakespeare.  
Requires: Pillow, Numpy. Needs the Images folder to be premade. Make sure to set your permissions so you can execute the shell script.  
Cronjob format to run the program daily and display it: `@daily /path/to/run.sh`  
Improvements: Add black and white one. Add one that uses a larger array of colors. Add one that is somehow weighted to be slightly more likely (no idea how).  
No testing of this has been done on any computer but my own so your mileage may vary.
